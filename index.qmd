I’m an entrepreneur and advisor with over 25 years of experience in SaaS, leadership, and digital transformation.
As the former CEO of [**Activesoft**](https://www.activesoft.com.br), I led a team of 180+ people and scaled the company to become one of Brazil’s top education technology platforms — later acquired by Arco Educação / Isaac, a NASDAQ-listed company.

Now based in Vancouver, Canada, I’m pursuing my **MBA in Business Analytics** at University Canada West, combining real-world leadership with data-driven strategy.
